# go-react-chat-real-time
This project creates a real-time chat app where users can send and receive messages. The backend uses Go with a RESTful API, the frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and MongoDB stores messages. Real-time updates are handled via WebSockets, with backend operations and data persistence running in parallel for efficiency
